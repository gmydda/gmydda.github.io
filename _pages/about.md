I'm a musician, coder, and aspiring civic technologist. In May 2025, I graduated cum laude from Case Western Reserve University with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in Political Science. In the past, I've worked a software engineer for the Cleveland Clinic in a research laboratory and for Sherwin Williams on the Delivery and Release Engineering team. As a musician, I am a classicaly trained pianist (CWRU's music program is heavily intertwined with the Cleveland Institute of Music) but I am most interested in experimentalism and electroacoustic music. I also dabble in jazz, which is where I first developed my interest in improvisation and experimentation. These days, I'm searching for roles that align with my values and allow me to leverage my skills as both a writer and a technologist.
